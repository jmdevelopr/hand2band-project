# Hand2band project

The first commit is my personal template I use when I start new projects. It contains things like
- React
- Typescript
- Styled-components
- Eslint and Prettier
and other frontend packages that I normally use in my everyday programming + react-router setup and basic components.
It helps me organize everything well and I hope it's okay to use it. 

Other commits are of course the code I wrote in the span of those 4 hours and are a reflection of my skills.
